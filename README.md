# BRR Suite

This is a C# library for converting modern, uncompressed audio files to the bit-rate reduction format (BRR) used by the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. For a user-friendly GUI employing this library, see my [BRR Suite GUI repository](https://github.com/spannerisms/BRRSuiteGUI).

Documentation is provided at [/docs/](./docs). XML documentation is included with the nuget.
